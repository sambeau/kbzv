  Use this skill when interacting with the Kanbanzai system as an agent: before starting
  implementation work, when assembling context, dispatching or completing tasks, writing
  commits, contributing knowledge entries, or spawning sub-agents. Activate for any task,
  not just complex ones.

## Purpose

This skill defines how agents interact with Kanbanzai: assembling context, dispatching
and completing tasks, writing commits, contributing knowledge, and spawning sub-agents.

## Context Assembly

Before starting work on any task, call `next` with a task ID to claim it and receive a
context packet:

    next(id="<task_id>")

The returned packet is byte-budgeted and prioritised — it contains the task instructions,
relevant knowledge entries, and design context trimmed to fit the budget. Read it before
doing anything else.

After completing the task, record which knowledge entries were used or found incorrect.
This drives auto-confirmation and auto-retirement:

- For entries you used and found correct: `knowledge(action="confirm", id="KE-...")`
- For entries you found incorrect: `knowledge(action="flag", id="KE-...", reason="...")`

## Task Dispatch and Completion

1. Call `next` (without an ID) to see ready tasks.
2. Call `next(id="TASK-...")` to atomically claim a task (transitions it from `ready` to `active`).
3. Do the work.
4. Call `finish` when done:

       finish(
         task_id="TASK-...",
         summary="What was done",
         files_modified=["path/to/file.go"],
         verification="What was tested or verified",
         knowledge=[...]
       )

## Commit Message Format

Every commit must follow this format: `<type>(<object-id>): <summary>`

| Type | When to use |
|---|---|
| `feat` | New feature behaviour |
| `fix` | Bug fix |
| `docs` | Documentation change only |
| `test` | Test-only change |
| `refactor` | Behaviour-preserving structural improvement |
| `workflow` | Workflow-state-only change (no code) |
| `decision` | Decision-record change |
| `chore` | Small maintenance change with no better category |

Add `!` after the type for breaking changes: `feat(FEAT-001)!: description`

Examples:
- `feat(FEAT-152): add profile editing API and validation`
- `fix(BUG-027): prevent avatar uploads hanging on large files`
- `workflow(TASK-152.3): mark upload task complete after verification`

## Knowledge Contribution

When you discover something reusable, contribute it:

    knowledge(
      action="contribute",
      topic="short-topic-slug",
      content="Concise, actionable statement",
      scope="<role or project>",
      tier=3
    )

Tier 3 is session-level (30-day TTL). The system auto-promotes entries to tier 2 based on
usage across sessions. You can also contribute via the `knowledge` argument in `finish`.

## Sub-Agent Spawning

When spawning sub-agents, include in every delegation message:

1. **Project name** — the codebase-memory-mcp project name for graph queries
2. **File scope boundaries** — which files the sub-agent should and should not modify
3. **Project conventions** — commit format, test conventions, language style rules
4. **Context propagation instruction** — if the sub-agent may itself spawn agents, tell
   it to include the same context in its delegations

`next` and `handoff` are the primary skill delivery mechanisms for MCP-connected sub-agents.
Prefer them over manually reciting conventions.

## Gotchas

**`next` fails when claiming a task:** Another agent already claimed the task. Call `next`
again (without an ID) to get an updated list of ready tasks.

**Tool call failures:** Read the error message before retrying. Most failures are
deterministic — retrying with the same arguments will produce the same error.

**Missing verification summary:** `finish` will succeed without `verification`, but it
degrades review quality and reduces the value of the knowledge base. Always include it.
