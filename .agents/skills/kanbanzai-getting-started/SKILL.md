  This repository is managed with Kanbanzai. Read this skill at the start of every
  session, before writing any code or running any searches. Kanbanzai provides MCP
  tools — next, entity, doc, status, and others — that replace manual grep and file
  searching for project state and work queue management. The presence of a .kbz/
  directory or kanbanzai tools in your tool list confirms you are in a
  Kanbanzai-managed project and this skill applies.

## Purpose

This skill orients you at the start of any session in a Kanbanzai-managed project.
Follow it before writing any code or making any changes.

## Preflight Check

Kanbanzai works through MCP tools. Before calling `next` or any other tool, confirm
the kanbanzai server is connected — your editor should list tools such as `next`,
`entity`, `doc`, and `status` as available.

If those tools are not available, the kanbanzai MCP server is not running. The
project's `.mcp.json` configures most editors automatically — check that the
kanbanzai binary is on your PATH and that your editor has loaded the MCP
configuration. See `docs/getting-started.md` for editor-specific setup instructions.

Do not substitute `grep`, `find`, or direct file reading for kanbanzai tool calls.
The workflow state in `.kbz/` is structured data — the MCP tools are the correct
interface for reading and writing it.

## Before Any Work

Run `git status`. If there are uncommitted changes from a previous session:

- If coherent and complete → commit them before starting new work.
- If incomplete or risky → stash them and note this for the human.

Never start new work on top of uncommitted changes from a different task.

## Understand the Project

Check for `AGENTS.md` in the repository root. If it exists, read it — it contains
project-specific conventions, structure, decisions, and reading order that override
generic guidance. If it does not exist, the Kanbanzai skills are your primary orientation.

## Check the Work Queue

Call `next` (without an ID) to see what tasks are ready. The work queue promotes eligible tasks
and returns them sorted by estimate and age.

If the queue is empty, call `status` or `entity` action: `list` to understand the current project
state: active features, open bugs, and their statuses.

## Assemble Context Before Starting a Task

Before beginning work on any task, call `next` with a task ID to claim it and receive
a context packet containing the task instructions, relevant knowledge entries, and
design context.

See `kanbanzai-agents` for the full dispatch-and-complete protocol.

## Understand the Workflow

Kanbanzai enforces stage gates that require human approval at specific points. Do not
skip stages or create entities without meeting the gate conditions.

See `kanbanzai-workflow` for:

- The six stage gates and what each requires
- What humans own vs. what agents own
- When to stop and ask the human (the emergency brake)
